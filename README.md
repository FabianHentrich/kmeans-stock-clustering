# K-Means Clustering of Stock Data

This project applies K-means clustering, with dimensionality reduction via t-SNE, to identify distinct groups of companies in the stock market based on their performance and sector information. The analysis explores how clustering can reveal patterns across different industries, highlight key performance attributes, and offer insights into company relationships within and between sectors.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to categorize stocks based on their performance characteristics using K-means clustering. By leveraging sector information and clustering results, we gain insights into commonalities and differences among companies across sectors and stages of production.

This analysis highlights both well-defined clusters (e.g., financial services, healthcare) and boundary clusters that may represent cross-sector entities or require further fine-tuning.
